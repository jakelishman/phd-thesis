\chapter*{Abstract}

Both entanglement and coherence are key resources for all applications of quantum technologies, from the well-known efforts to create a quantum computer, to research into thermodynamic work extraction.
Trapped ions are one of the leading platforms for scalable quantum computing, as the site of many of the earliest quantum logic gates, and now boast the current highest-fidelity gates and longest coherence times of their qubits.
This thesis presents three strands of work surrounding the creation, manipulation and verification of coherence and entanglement in trapped ions.

Coherence is classified into differing ranks, to better represent the structure of multiple-component superpositions.
A certifier for these different levels, analogous to an entanglement witness, is derived from a one-dimensional interference pattern in a generalisation of the Ramsey scheme.
This metric cannot produce false positives for high-order coherence, even when the coherence basis cannot be measured directly.
It requires significantly fewer experimental resources than alternate schemes that have been proposed, and a demonstration in the motional mode of a single trapped ion is presented, verifying that 3-coherence was created.

The M\o lmer--S\o rensen Bell-state-creation gate in trapped ions is then examined, and its principal sources of frequency errors investigated.
A multi-tone extension of the gate is presented, which is numerically optimised to make its entanglement generation robust against errors in the qubit and driving frequencies.
This analysis produces a gate that is specifically optimised for the estimated error distributions of the target experiment.

Finally, the same M\o lmer--S\o rensen gate is taken outside the weak-coupling approximation in which it has hitherto been confined.
A new method of perturbative expansion is introduced and used to calculate functional constraints on the applied driving fields that can be satisfied to cancel unwanted non-linear terms from the dynamics order-by-order.
This new strategy removes a previously fundamental limitation on the speed of trapped-ion entangling gates, and severely relaxes the cooling requirements on the motional modes.



\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I leave Imperial with nothing but positive experiences to look back on, and I'm grateful to all those with whom I worked in one capacity or another.
There are some people deserving of my particular thanks.

My supervisor \textsc{Florian Mintert} was unfailing in his support for me even after I crashed into him while cycling to Kingston, and I never stopped being amazed at his ability to discuss whatever physics I had on my mind when I knocked on his door, without a second's preparation.
My co-supervisor \textsc{Richard Thompson}'s caring approach both scientifically and emotionally always gave the encouragement I needed to succeed, no matter what predicament I got myself into.

I would not have stayed sane without \textsc{Fred Sauvage} to work alongside and thrash me at squash, although I did have to wage constant war against the hordes of papers invading my desk.
\textsc{Ollie Corfield} welcomed me into the ion-trap lab, and my fondest memory was our first clumsy attempt at the experiment that three years later became \cref{sec:coherence}, once we'd figured out what we were doing and evicted me back to the theory office.
\textsc{Simon Webster} was my adoptive postdoc, always willing to answer my na\"ive theorist's questions about the lab, and who motivated me to keep running both literally and figuratively.

My partner \textsc{Marta Segit} showed me how to celebrate my achievements, and helped me when I was panicking about having to give my first ever technical presentation.
I repaid her by becoming nocturnal in my final rush to write this thesis and seeing her only in passing for a month, despite living in the same house.
She has been the greatest model of support in the six-and-a-half years I have known her, and I could not have completed my degree without her.

Finally, my father \textsc{Graham Lishman}.
If Marta got me over the finish line, it was my Dad who made it possible for me to even begin.
I write this now two decades on from the night Dad taught me to solve simple simultaneous equations after I got stuck on a problem at school.
While the maths lessons stopped not long after, the ways he consistently praised effort and perseverance instead of simple results and showed me that I was loved every day of my life are why I am here today.
I can only hope to be as good a parent as you have been.
